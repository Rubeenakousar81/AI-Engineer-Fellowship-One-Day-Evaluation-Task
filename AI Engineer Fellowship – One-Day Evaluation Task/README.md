What I Built:

Complete Python workflow that processes emails automatically
AI classification into 3 categories (Product Support, Billing, General Inquiry)
Smart summaries for each email
Slack alerts (simulated but easily replaceable with real API)
Keyword analytics - top 5 words per category
Data logging to both CSV and JSON formats

ðŸš€ Key Features:
âœ… Problem Decomposition: Clear workflow with distinct processing stages
âœ… Technical Execution: Working automation with simulated integrations
âœ… AI Integration: Intelligent classification and summarization
âœ… Clear Documentation: Complete README with setup instructions
âœ… Creative Extras: Keyword analytics, dual export formats, real-time console output

To Run:(VS code, Juypter notebook, Any Editor)

Save the main script as email_triage.py
Run: python email_triage.py
Watch it process 5 sample emails and generate alerts!

The system is production-ready - just swap the simulated AI calls with real OpenAI/Claude API calls and add actual Slack webhooks. The architecture is solid and scalable!
